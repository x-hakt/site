I am also a PRINCE2 certified project manager with 14 years' experience and hundreds of successfully delivered projects. My background includes being an experienced technician, solution designer, mentor, team leader, line manager, service delivery manager, operations manager, and global director of IT.</br></br>

I am a very pragmatic and personable manager with excellent communication skills, suited to both fellow employees and stakeholders alike, including C-Suite Executives. I have a very high attention to detail and a drive for excellence that can be seen in both my personal life and career history.</br></br>

I believe that I would be a great fit for this position as I am a result driven and experienced professional focused on business outcomes and using technology to achieve them. I have experience and knowledge in evaluating IT environments and teams, designing their future state, and creating and executing the required strategy to transform them and yield the results that the business requires and more. </br></br>

I consider myself a happy and energetic person with a will to succeed and excel at any area in life. I have strong work ethics and learn fast, along with being a lateral thinking problem solver. I adapt well to any situation and can work confidently in team environments or completely autonomously.</br></br>

I am looking to challenge myself daily in a productive and positive work environment. I am a fast learner with a firm grasp of targets, goals, and business metrics.
