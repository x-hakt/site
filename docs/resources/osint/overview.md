OSINT (Outsourced Intelligence) is what it says on the tin. Using various tools and websites found around the internet to gather information on a particular business, person, site, area, location, etc. It comes in many shapes and sizes and the use cases can be infinite, as can your approach depending on your target outcome. For example enumerating DNS records... great for digging into a corportions public website, not so good for finding regular human civilian.
