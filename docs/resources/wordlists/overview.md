Wordlists can be both a blessing and a curse in the cybersecurity world. On one hand a good wordlist can be just what you need to brute force your way through a security layer, but on the other hand if you make a huge and all-encompassing wordlist it will take forever to process. Everyone has their own preferences and balance to find, but Kali's built-in rockyou.txt is a pretty solid place to start for begginners.
