# Welcome, friend!

I'm Chris, and this is my own little corner of the internet for my 'professional side'. Work type stuff and things that mostly connect to how I earn a living and related topics.

Feel free to poke around and check the place out and drop me a line if you desire! I'm always up for expanding my professional network, unless you're selling something... then please don't waste either of our time (:

    While this site is intended to be politically correct and professional, I don't plan on writing my blogs entries like a corporate email or LinkedIn post. Please use common sense when reading them; I'm a very humerous person that acts with candor in all situations.
