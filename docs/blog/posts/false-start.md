# False Start

I got caught up in the little details of how this site functions and just dropped it cold, but with some renwed inspiration I decided to go back to the drawing board and 'fix' what I couldn't get working. I got about 90% of the way there... so it'll do for now.

There's a lot of content I need to port over from my private Confluence (one day), but for now I'm starting AZ-104 fresh and intend on using this site to summaries each section as I go.
