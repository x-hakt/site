# Team X-HAKT Begins

Ahoy! Welcome to the brand new home of Team X-HAKT (Team x-hacked, or Team Exact... you chose what feels right for you to believe). A new site, new team, new project and new home for those involved can  both deposit and exposit our combined knowledge across the areas of interest. Those areas? Well they range from System Administration (Windows, Linux, Cloud, etc) to coding, to cybersecurity, and so on and so forth. If we're learning something or have something we think would be nice to have documented for the internet masses to find and reference then we'll do our best to make sure it ends up here.

What else is Team X-HAKT? We're a team and collective of enthusiasts with various specialties and interests opting to share knowledge in relative anonymity, but also to take on challenges such as CTF's in order to learn and grow together. If you would like to get involved then get in touch via our socials!
